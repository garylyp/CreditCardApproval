# CreditCardApproval
A Deep Learning Neural Network that helps banks decide if a credit loan application should be approved or not

# Set Up
This project is not done using Jupyter Notebook but instead plain old python. Ensure you have anaconda installed and the remaining libraries should be all part of the conda packages. The main network uses Keras. You may wish to use Tensorflow(Recommended) or Theano as your backend. Checkout the installation guides for the respective tools if you do not have them!!!
